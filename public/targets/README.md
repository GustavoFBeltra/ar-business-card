# Image Target

Place your compiled `card.mind` file here.

## How to compile:

1. Go to https://hiukim.github.io/mind-ar-js-doc/tools/compile
2. Upload your card front image (the design MindAR will track)
3. Download the compiled `.mind` file
4. Rename it to `card.mind` and place it in this folder

## Tips:
- Use a high-resolution image of the card front (300+ DPI)
- Ensure the image has sufficient visual features (edges, corners, contrast)
- Test with the actual printed card, not just the digital design
